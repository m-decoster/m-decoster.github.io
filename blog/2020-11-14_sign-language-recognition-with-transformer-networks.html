    <h2>Sign Language Recognition with Transformer Networks</h2>
    <p class="post-preview-date">14 November 2020</p>
    <p>The 12th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC) was supposed to be held
in Marseille in May 2020. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the conference was cancelled, but the organizers
worked hard to publish the proceedings. Now, the committee has decided to disseminate the conference proceedings over
the course of ten weeks. In this post, I present a high-level overview of my submission to LREC 2020,
<a href="https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8660743/file/8660744.pdf">Sign Language Recognition with Transformer Networks</a>.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There is an undeniable communication barrier between deaf people communicating through sign language and hearing people
communicating through speech. Within the domain of artificial intelligence lies a possible solution to bringing down
this barrier: automatic sign language interpreters. These interpreters could for example run on mobile devices,
and translate between sign language and speech or text. They would be powered by machine learning algorithms, in particular
deep learning algorithms. These deep learning algorithms require a large amount of data to work properly, and unfortunately
these data are not as readily available as they are for verbal languages. Sign language recognition systems are therefore less
powerful than speech recognition systems and natural language processing systems operating on written text.</p>
<p>One of the aims of my research project is to support the annotation process of sign language corpora. These are large collections
of video data of conversations between native signers. This annotation process involves aligning labels to video. These labels range
from textual translations to mouth shapes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(annotation)#Glossing_sign_languages">glosses</a>.
This is a time consuming process that requires expertise. At IDLab-AIRO, we wish to speed up the annotation process by automating certain actions.
Not only would this aid linguistics researchers, but it would also lead to the availability of larger datasets for the purpose
of sign language recognition and translation.</p>
<p>This paper presents a solution for the &quot;isolated sign recognition&quot; problem. Specifically, this means that the proposed system is able
to recognize individual signs in small video fragments: one video contains one sign. Many isolated sign recognition
systems are trained on datasets that contain repetitions of signs (which we will call &quot;machine learning datasets&quot; as they are often created for the purpose
of training a sign language recognition system).
In our case, we train it on isolated signs that are cut from a conversation.
This introduces additional complexity through sign transitions: the starting hand shapes and positions differ between different productions
of the same sign based on context. It also introduces
machine learning challenges as our datasets suffer from heavy class imbalance and different vocabularies per person.
An isolated sign recognition system can be used to provide annotation suggestions: when an annotator selects a video, a list of suggestions is shown.
With sufficient accuracy, annotating as the correct sign is one click away.</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>We recognize signs by using what we call &quot;transformer networks&quot;. Specifically, the neural network consists of three parts: a feature extractor that processes
individual frames of the video, a sequential processing module, and a classifier. We present 4 model variants and compare them:</p>
<ul>
<li>PoseLSTM: an OpenPose feature extractor followed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network</li>
<li>Pose Transformer Network (PTN): an OpenPose feature extractor followed by a transformer</li>
<li>Video Transformer Network (VTN): a ResNet feature extractor followed by a transformer</li>
<li>Multi-modal Transformer Network (MTN): an OpenPose feature extractor and ResNet feature extractor followed by a transformer</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenPose<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> is a system that is able to extract human pose from input images. This is a powerful feature extraction approach for problems
such as action, gesture, and sign language recognition. By extracting human pose, background noise can easily be removed. By normalizing poses,
the distance of the subject to the camera and other factors can also be accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/openpose.png" alt="Example of OpenPose output" />
<em>OpenPose outputs coordinates and confidence values of keypoints of the human body.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></em></p>
<p>LSTMs, or Long Short-Term Memory networks, are a form of recurrent neural networks that are able to process sequences. I won't go into detail here because there
are plenty of informative resources on LSTMs. The main thing to remember is that these networks are very good at processing sequential data as they keep a hidden state that functions
as a memory cell.</p>
<p>Transformers are a more recent sequence processing architecture, introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
The transformer architecture uses multi-head attention, which means that multiple attention calculations are performed in parallel.
Attention itself is based on three input tensors: the query, key, and value. The query and key are used to create a mask, to which
the softmax operation is applied. This mask is used to <em>attend</em> to certain regions of the value. In this way, the neural network can learn
to pay attention to certain input regions based on its inputs. Attention is applied in parallel in a single layer (in multiple heads), and there are many such layers.
In the traditional transformer, there is both an encoder and a decoder, and the way they compute their query, key and value tensors is different. However,
in this work, query, key and value are all computed from the input features; the encoder-decoder architecture is not needed for this problem.
For an in-depth explanation of the transformer architecture I heartily recommend reading through <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html">this explanatory notebook</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/multiheadattention.png" alt="A single multi-head attention layer with two heads" />
<em>A 2-head attention layer applies attention twice, in parallel, and processes the outputs of both heads after concatenation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></em></p>
<p>Introduced in 2019 by Kozlov et al.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>, Video Transformer Networks (VTNs) use a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a feature extractor
for individual frames, followed by several multi-head attention layers for sequence processing. While the resulting accuracy on benchmark datasets is lower than that of  competing
3D CNN architectures, the VTN uses fewer parameters. This is especially useful for a problem like sign language recognition, where overfitting
lurks around every corner because of the small dataset sizes. The promising results of Kozlov et al. using this network architecture on action recognition tasks,
and the lower number of parameters, lead to our decision to apply VTNs to sign language recognition.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we compared several architectures on the same isolated sign recognition problem. For details on architectures and hyperparameters,
you can refer to <a href="https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8660743/file/8660744.pdf">the paper itself</a>.</p>
<p>We noticed in our experiments that OpenPose yielded good results, but due to noise on the poses (especially of the hands), ResNets were able to
extract better features. As a final experiment, we combined both pose features and ResNet features into a single model with spatial attention to combine
both features. This resulted in slightly better results still. In the future, more robust hand pose estimation techniques or robust pre-processing may be used
to improve performance of networks using OpenPose as a feature extractor.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>In the end, the best result was achieved with both feature types: for 100 signs, we achieved a top-1 accuracy of 74.4% on 100 classes. For a suggestion system,
the top-5 accuracy is also interesting (this is the percentage of times the correct value was in the top-5 of predictions of the neural network); this was 89.81%.
In other words, in almost 90% of the cases, the correct gloss is in the network's first five guesses. Important note: that is, if the given sign is part of the vocabulary, of course.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/learningcurve.png" alt="A learning curve for the MTN model" />
<em>Having access to more labeled data would allow the MTN to achieve even higher accuracy.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></em></p>
<p>As part of the evaluation of our model, we visualized a learning curve. This figure clearly indicates
that having access to more labeled data would lead to better performance,
and, extrapolating, the model would reach very high accuracy with twice the data.
Our conclusion is therefore that current deep learning algorithms are clearly powerful enough for
isolated sign recognition with lexical vocabularies,
and the performance bottleneck lies in the available labeled data. This reinforces our research project: gathering more data is important, therefore
supporting annotators of sign language corpora is an important research goal.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This work focused on isolated sign recognition with a limited dataset originating from sign language corpora: signs were cut from a conversation.
The main remaining challenge in the domain of isolated sign recognition according to us is the recognition of non-lexical signs and scaling up to larger vocabularies.</p>
