            <h1>Streamlining Robotics Projects: Why You Might Want to Try airo-mono</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">17 April 2025</p>
            <p>In the world of robotics, the Robot Operating System (ROS) is both loved and hated. On one hand, its extensive ecosystem offers libraries for almost any task imaginable. On the other hand, installation can be a hassle, performance with default settings may be lacking, and for many projects, ROS can introduce unnecessary complexity when a single process would suffice.</p>

            <h1>Quality of Life with SSH</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">11 March 2025</p>
            <p>As part of my day job, I've been working more than usually with SSH, working with remote connections to robots and creating SSH tunnels to handle (semi-)complex networking set-ups. I kept forgetting certain parts of my set-up every time I had to do this again, so I took some notes and decided to share them here.</p>

            <h1>PhD Defence</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">21 June 2024</p>
            <p>Today, I defended my PhD on &quot;Neural Sign Language Translation: Towards Sign Language Applications Powered by Artificial Intelligence&quot; at Ghent University. I enjoyed sharing my research with my family and friends and was overwhelmed by the compliments from the jury and audience.</p>

            <h1>Presenting at IDLab Day 2024</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">19 June 2024</p>
            <p>As the &quot;final act&quot; of my PhD before my public defence this Friday, I gave a presentation on IDLab-AIRO's work on one shot sign language recognition at the yearly IDLab (UGent - UAntwerpen - imec) teambuilding event, IDLab Day 2024.</p>

            <h1>Plato&#x27;s multilingual large language models</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">17 March 2024</p>
            <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can analyze both text and images, suggesting a step towards visual reasoning. They can also generate new data in both modalities, suggesting that they are creative. However, this ability doesn't equate to true artificial general intelligence (AGI). MLLMs, in a way, resemble the prisoners in Plato's allegory of the cave.</p>
