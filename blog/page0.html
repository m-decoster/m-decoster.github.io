            <h1>Quality of Life with SSH</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">11 March 2025</p>
            <p>As part of my day job, I've been working more than usually with SSH, working with remote connections to robots and creating SSH tunnels to handle (semi-)complex networking set-ups. I kept forgetting certain parts of my set-up every time I had to do this again, so I took some notes and decided to share them here.</p>

            <h1>PhD Defence</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">21 June 2024</p>
            <p>Today, I defended my PhD on &quot;Neural Sign Language Translation: Towards Sign Language Applications Powered by Artificial Intelligence&quot; at Ghent University. I enjoyed sharing my research with my family and friends and was overwhelmed by the compliments from the jury and audience.</p>

            <p>As the &quot;final act&quot; of my PhD before my public defence this Friday, I gave a presentation on IDLab-AIRO's work on one shot sign language recognition at the yearly IDLab (UGent - UAntwerpen - imec) teambuilding event, IDLab Day 2024.</p>

            <h1>Plato&#x27;s multilingual large language models</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">17 March 2024</p>
            <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can analyze both text and images, suggesting a step towards visual reasoning. They can also generate new data in both modalities, suggesting that they are creative. However, this ability doesn't equate to true artificial general intelligence (AGI). MLLMs, in a way, resemble the prisoners in Plato's allegory of the cave.</p>

            <h1>Post-mortem: that time I created a DSL for grading student projects</h1>
            <p class="post-preview-date">24 February 2024</p>
            <p>In an academic setting, we aim to grade student projects as objectively as possible. In the Master of Computer Science Engineering program at Ghent University, the machine learning course traditionally featured a significant project component contributing to the final grade. Throughout the course, students delivered three interim presentations, each evaluated by three assessors: the professor and two teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure consistency and fairness, we implemented a rubric system where assessors delineated specific criteria. To streamline the assessment process, we automated the process using a custom built tool, which also included a Domain Specific Language (DSL).</p>
