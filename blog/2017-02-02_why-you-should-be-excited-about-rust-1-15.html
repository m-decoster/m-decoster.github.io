    <h2>Why you should be excited about Rust 1.15</h2>
    <p class="post-preview-date">02 February 2017</p>
    <p>Today marks the release of <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/02/Rust-1.15.html">Rust 1.15</a>. I have been eagerly awaiting this specific release
for a while, because it comes with procedural macros and custom derives.
You should be excited too, because this release means a lot for production
Rust without having to use nightly releases.</p>
<p>In the past, Rust has allowed you to derive certain pre-defined traits
for your structs and enums. Examples include <code>Copy</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code>.
Imagine that you want to create an enum and you want to check if
instances of the enum are equal. Here's what you'd do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Eq, PartialEq)]
enum Fruit {
    Apple,
    Orange,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler would generate an implementation of the <code>Eq</code> and <code>PartialEq</code>
traits for you. Easy and clean.</p>
<p>However, before today, stable Rust derive was limited to the pre-defined traits. Useful crates like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">Serde</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/diesel">Diesel</a> provided custom derives,
but these were only available on nightly.</p>
<p>Not anymore! Since today, if you update rust (<code>rustup update stable</code>),
you can use custom derives on stable! That's right. You can now use
Serde and Diesel on stable.</p>
<p>I won't go into details on how to actually write procedural macros in
this particular blog post, but just show you why this is really great.
Previously, if you wanted to use Serde on stable with custom derives,
you would have to jump through all kinds of hoops to get your code working.</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Fruit {
    Apple,
    Orange,
}
</code></pre>
<p>and your enum will be able to serialize to JSON and other formats.</p>
<p>Equally awesome is that Diesel now works on stable too. Imagine
having a type safe ORM library. Imagine not having to write SQL statements.
Imagine it only taking a few lines of code.</p>
<p>The greatest thing however, is that this means that Rust just gained
a lot of bonus points as a production ready language. Diesel and Serde
are two important libraries for writing applications in Rust. Now that they
no longer require nightly to use properly, a major roadblock for stable
Rust application development has been removed.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is why you should be excited about Rust 1.15.</p>
