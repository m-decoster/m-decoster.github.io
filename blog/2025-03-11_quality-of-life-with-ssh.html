    <h2>Quality of Life with SSH</h2>
    <p class="post-preview-date">11 March 2025</p>
    <p>As part of my day job, I've been working more than usually with SSH, working with remote connections to robots and creating SSH tunnels to handle (semi-)complex networking set-ups. I kept forgetting certain parts of my set-up every time I had to do this again, so I took some notes and decided to share them here.</p>
<p>This post contains information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to safely use git on an SSH server with a shared user account (without sharing private keys with other people)</li>
<li>How to set up an SSH tunnel</li>
<li>How to use graphical applications that run on the remote server with X forwarding</li>
</ul>
<h3>The set-up</h3>
<p>The robot set-up I most recently worked on has a router (we'll give it the hostname <code>router</code>) and a mini-PC connected to the router via ethernet (we'll give it the hostname <code>brain</code>, because it's where the robot application code is run.) We connect to <code>router</code> from our personal workstation over Wi-Fi. Let's assume everything is running Ubuntu 24.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/ssh_diagram.svg" alt="diagram of setup" /></p>
<p>Let's say <code>router</code> is at the address 10.10.120.1 and <code>brain</code> at 10.10.42.57 (on <code>router</code>'s network). We have an account <code>user</code> on both computers.</p>
<h3>SSH configuration file</h3>
<p>The first step is to set up an SSH configuration file, typically stored in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.
Let's set it up so that we can simply use the command <code>ssh router</code> instead of <code>ssh user@10.10.120.1</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host router
	Hostname 10.10.120.1
	User user

Host brain
	Hostname 10.42.0.57
	User user
	ProxyJump router
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>brain</code> uses a <code>ProxyJump</code> via <code>router</code>, so that we can simply use <code>ssh brain</code> instead of having to go through the <code>router</code> manually.</p>
<h3>Public-private key authentication</h3>
<p>Right now, we always need to manually enter <code>user</code>'s password (and twice if we SSH into <code>brain</code>). Let's use keys to authenticate instead.
To generate a new key pair, we can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>We don't want to store our private key in plain text, so enter a passphrase. We also don't want to have to enter this passphrase every time we use our key, so let's add it to the SSH agent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>The remote server must know about our public key. We shouldn't just copy it over there, but use these commands to do this securely:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ssh-copy-id user@router
$ ssh-copy-id user@brain
</code></pre>
<p>The keys will now be on the remote computers under <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can enter <code>ssh brain</code> or <code>ssh router</code> and not have to enter any passphrases!</p>
<h3>SSH tunneling</h3>
<p>Let's say <code>brain</code> is running a service on some port, that we wish to connect to from our workstation directly. We can use an SSH tunnel for that.
For example, we want to use ports 7000 and 7001 as if the service was running on our workstation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ssh -N -L localhost:7000:brain:7000 -L localhost:7001:brain:7001 router
</code></pre>
<p><code>-N</code> suppresses the output, and we add <code>-L</code> for every port. This command should &quot;hang&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we can go to <code>localhost:7000</code> (resp. <code>localhost:7001</code>) to access this service!</p>
<p>I recommend turning this into an alias, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ alias tun_brain=&quot;ssh -N -L localhost:7000:brain:7000 -L localhost:7001:brain:7001 router&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>so we can just use</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ tun_brain
</code></pre>
<p>instead of remembering the tunnel command.</p>
<h3>X forwarding</h3>
<p>Let's say we want to run a graphical application on <code>brain</code> or <code>router</code> as if it were running on our own workstation. We can use X forwarding for that (assuming we're using X11 :).)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host router
	Hostname 10.10.120.1
	User user
	ForwardX11 yes

Host brain
	Hostname 10.42.0.57
	User user
	ProxyJump router
	ForwardX11 yes
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run, e.g., <code>nautilus</code> and get a graphical file browser on <code>router</code> or <code>brain</code>. Not the most useful application, but useful for other applications such as <code>gnome-control-center</code> to change settings.</p>
<h3>Using git over SSH, over SSH</h3>
<p>Finally, we want to be able to use <code>git</code> on the remote servers. But, remember how we shared an account with other people? We can use the SSH agent to securely transfer our keys on demand.</p>
<p>All we have to do is change our config again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host router
	Hostname 10.10.120.1
	User user
	ForwardX11 yes
	ForwardAgent yes

Host brain
	Hostname 10.42.0.57
	User user
	ProxyJump router
	ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use <code>git</code> on the remote computers without needing to store our private keys.</p>
