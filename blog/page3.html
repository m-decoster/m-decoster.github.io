            <h2>Dark mode enabled</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">24 March 2021</p>
            <p>I recently happened upon the CSS media query <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>.
As of today, dark mode is enabled on my blog. Light mode is still available too.
It all depends on your settings.</p>

            <h2>Rust, Markdown, and a sprinkle of HTML</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">14 December 2020</p>
            <p>I created this website about a year ago and it has evolved quite a bit since its inception. From pure HTML
to Markdown and a custom static site generator, my focus on a high signal to noise ratio and fast loading times
were one of the only constants.</p>

            <h2>Sign Language Recognition with Transformer Networks</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">14 November 2020</p>
            <p>The 12th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC) was supposed to be held
in Marseille in May 2020. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the conference was cancelled, but the organizers
worked hard to publish the proceedings. Now, the committee has decided to disseminate the conference proceedings over
the course of ten weeks. In this post, I present a high-level overview of my submission to LREC 2020,
<a href="https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8660743/file/8660744.pdf">Sign Language Recognition with Transformer Networks</a>.</p>

            <h2>Compile time CUDA device checking in Rust</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">24 July 2020</p>
            <p>Stable <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is <a href="https://without.boats/blog/shipping-const-generics/">soon</a> getting const generics.
Let's look at how const generics can be used to avoid a certain bug at compile time. The bug?
Trying to perform operations on data on separate CUDA devices in <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>.</p>

            <h2>Mod support with ZIP archives</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">22 July 2018</p>
            <p>In this blog post, we will go over an ingenious system used in some of the older games created by id Software,
in particular Quake 3: Arena, that made it very easy to create mods. The same system was used in games derived
from the idTech 3 engine, such as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. We will also discuss how you can implement it in your own
game engine.</p>
