            <h2>Compile time CUDA device checking in Rust</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">24 July 2020</p>
            <p>Stable <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is <a href="https://without.boats/blog/shipping-const-generics/">soon</a> getting const generics.
Let's look at how const generics can be used to avoid a certain bug at compile time. The bug?
Trying to perform operations on data on separate CUDA devices in <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>.</p>

            <h2>Mod support with ZIP archives</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">22 July 2018</p>
            <p>In this blog post, we will go over an ingenious system used in some of the older games created by id Software,
in particular Quake 3: Arena, that made it very easy to create mods. The same system was used in games derived
from the idTech 3 engine, such as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. We will also discuss how you can implement it in your own
game engine.</p>

            <h2>Setting up Apache Spark with Java on Windows</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">15 April 2018</p>
            <p>Setting up Spark for use in Java in Windows is fairly easy if you know what to do. I will take you through the steps needed here.</p>

            <h2>Move semantics: an introduction in C++</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">01 September 2017</p>
            <p>Move semantics are an important subject in two popular system programming languages: Rust and C++(11). Rust takes a fundamentally different approach to move semantics than C++, being move-by-default.
This blog post will assume (beginner-level) knowledge of C++ and Rust and can serve as an introduction to move semantics as a concept before moving on to more technical explanations and reasoning behind certain implementations.
It is especially interesting to people coming from Rust that want to know how to emulate the behaviour they have come to expect from that language.</p>

            <h2>Why you should be excited about Rust 1.15</h2>
            <p class="post-preview-date">02 February 2017</p>
            <p>Today marks the release of <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/02/Rust-1.15.html">Rust 1.15</a>. I have been eagerly awaiting this specific release
for a while, because it comes with procedural macros and custom derives.
You should be excited too, because this release means a lot for production
Rust without having to use nightly releases.</p>
