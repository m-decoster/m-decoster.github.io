    <h1>PhD Defence</h1>
    <p class="post-preview-date">21 June 2024</p>
    <p>Today, I defended my PhD on &quot;Neural Sign Language Translation: Towards Sign Language Applications Powered by Artificial Intelligence&quot; at Ghent University. I enjoyed sharing my research with my family and friends and was overwhelmed by the compliments from the jury and audience.</p>
<p>It has been an incredible journey during which I've been surrounded by my loving family, friends and colleagues. The research on sign language recognition performed at AIRO in the past few years has led to several high impact publications
and a follow-up valorisation project <a href="https://amai.vlaanderen/projecten/project3-gebaar">Wat Gebaar Jij?!</a>, which I am very excited about.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/defence1.jpg" alt="phd" /></p>
<p>What's next? I will continue working at <a href="https://airo.ugent.be">IDLab-AIRO</a>, now on intelligent robotic manipulation, specifically on the valorisation of the research done by our PhD students. I will continue to stay involved in the groundbreaking sign language recognition research performed in Flanders, which is now being done by a junior PhD student at our lab.</p>
